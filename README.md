# TGMamba

## About

Mamba is a new state space model architecture showing promising performance on information-dense data such as language modeling, where previous subquadratic models fall short of Transformers.
It is based on the line of progress on [structured state space models](https://github.com/state-spaces/s4),
with an efficient hardware-aware design and implementation in the spirit of [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention).

## Installation

Run `pip install .` from this repository.

If `pip` complains about PyTorch versions, try passing `--no-build-isolation` to `pip`.

Requirements:
- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU
- PyTorch 1.12+
- CUDA 11.6+
- PyTorch Geometric (we use 2.5.2)

## Usage (key modifications)

### Selective SSM

Mamba is based on a selective SSM layer, which is the focus of the paper (Section 3; Algorithm 2).

Source: [ops/selective_scan_interface.py](mamba_ssm/ops/selective_scan_interface.py).

For now, we use the ref functions.

### Mamba Block

The main module of this repository is the TGMamba architecture block wrapping the selective SSM.

Source: [modules/tgmamba_simple.py](mamba_ssm/modules/tgmamba_simple.py).

Usage:
``` python
import torch
from mamba_ssm import Mamba

batch, length, dim = 2, 64, 32
x = torch.randn(batch, length, dim).to("cuda")
model = TGMamba(
    # This module uses roughly 3 * expand * d_model^2 parameters
    d_model=dim, # Model dimension d_model
    d_state=16,  # SSM state expansion factor
    d_conv=4,    # Local convolution width
    expand=2,    # Block expansion factor
).to("cuda")
y = model(x)
assert y.shape == x.shape
```

### Mamba-2 (Note: not yet used)

The Mamba-2 block is implemented at [modules/mamba2.py](mamba_ssm/modules/mamba2.py).

A simpler version is at [modules/mamba2_simple.py](mamba_ssm/modules/mamba2_simple.py)

The usage is similar to Mamba(-1):
``` python
from mamba_ssm import Mamba2
model = Mamba2(
    # This module uses roughly 3 * expand * d_model^2 parameters
    d_model=dim, # Model dimension d_model
    d_state=64,  # SSM state expansion factor, typically 64 or 128
    d_conv=4,    # Local convolution width
    expand=2,    # Block expansion factor
).to("cuda")
y = model(x)
assert y.shape == x.shape
```

#### SSD (Note: not yet used)

A minimal version of the inner SSD module (Listing 1 from the Mamba-2 paper) with conversion between "discrete" and "continuous" SSM versions
is at [modules/ssd_minimal.py](mamba_ssm/modules/ssd_minimal.py).

## Training

Run train.py. Model checkpoints etc. are stored in the [results](results) directory.

## Evaluations

To evaluate the model, run eval.py. Model checkpoints etc. are stored in the [results](results) directory.

## Inference (TODO)

The script [benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py](benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py)
1. autoloads a model from the Hugging Face Hub,
2. generates completions of a user-specified prompt,
3. benchmarks the inference speed of this generation.

Other configurable options include the top-p (nucleus sampling) probability, and the softmax temperature.

### Examples

To test generation latency (e.g. batch size = 1) with different sampling strategies:

``` sh
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "state-spaces/mamba-2.8b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --topp 0.9 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "EleutherAI/pythia-2.8b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --topp 0.9 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "state-spaces/mamba-2.8b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --minp 0.05 --topk 0 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
```

To test generation throughput with random prompts (e.g. large batch size):
``` sh
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "state-spaces/mamba-2.8b" --batch 64
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "EleutherAI/pythia-2.8b" --batch 64
```

With Mamba-2, you just need to change the model name:
``` sh
python benchmarks/benchmark_generation_mamba_simple.py --model-name "state-spaces/mamba2-2.7b" --prompt "My cat wrote all this CUDA code for a new language model and" --topp 0.9 --temperature 0.7 --repetition-penalty 1.2
```


## Troubleshooting

### Precision
Our models were trained using PyTorch [AMP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/amp.html) for mixed precision. AMP keeps model parameters in float32 and casts to half precision when necessary.
On the other hand, other frameworks like DeepSpeed store parameters in float16 and upcasts when necessary (e.g. for optimizer accumulation).

We've observed that higher precision for the main model parameters may be necessary, because SSMs are sensitive to their recurrent dynamics. If you are experiencing instabilities,
as a first step please try a framework storing parameters in fp32 (such as AMP).

### Initialization
Some parts of the model have initializations inherited from prior work on S4 models.
For [example](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/f0affcf69f06d1d06cef018ff640bf080a11c421/mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py#L102), the $\Delta$ parameter has a targeted range by initializing the bias of its linear projection.
However, some frameworks may have post-initialization hooks (e.g. setting all bias terms in `nn.Linear` modules to zero).
If this is the case, you may have to add custom logic (e.g. this [line](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba/blob/f0affcf69f06d1d06cef018ff640bf080a11c421/mamba_ssm/modules/mamba_simple.py#L104) turns off re-initializing in our trainer, but would be a no-op in any other framework)
that is specific to the training framework.
